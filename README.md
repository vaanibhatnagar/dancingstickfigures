# Dancing Stick-figures
This repository demonstrates an evolutionary algorithm (GA/ES) optimizing phase values for a dancing stick figure that synchronizes movements with music beats.

## Project Structure
We've refactored the code intos 3 main modules and a runner:
1. `genetic_algo.py` - Handles beat pattern creation and genetic algorithm optimization.
2. `sound_gen.py` - Generates metronome audio synchronized with beats.
3. `animation.py` - Initialize and handle stick-figure movements.
4. `dance_runner.py` - Combine and run dancing stick-figure
